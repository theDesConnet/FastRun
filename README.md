# What is this?

FastRun is a very small but useful utility for Windows. It allows to execute your favourite programs, URLs, files, directories and other stuff from any place like Command Prompt (CMD), "Run" window (Win + R), etc.\
FastRun is a 100% portable program. No need to install program - just download and run!

### *FastRun is developed by me for my personal purposes, but if you find this stuff worths it, I will be very pleased :3*

**WARNING!** FastRun requires .NET Framework 4.7.2 to be installed. FastRun probably will NOT work under Windows XP and older OSes (we are not sure even about Wine under non-Windows).
